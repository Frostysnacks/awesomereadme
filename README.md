# awesomereadme
## Description

This is a readme generator that generates a readme through prompts in the terminal using JS Node. This project was my first application I made using JS Node features, so it was a challenge to make, I hope you like it!


## Installation
run the npm init -y command and then install inquirer 8.2.4 by using the npm i inquirer@8.2.4 command in the terminal

## Usage
Use node index.js in the command line and answer the prompts in the terminal to generate a readme file based on your prompt answers!
